## A Physicist with inclination in Language, Machine Learning and [Cognition](http://cogito-mag.ml/) - especially Natural Language Processing and NP-Hard evolution algorithms for statistical systems of large degrees of freedom. 

### *MOTTO :* “… and anything that man knows, which is not merely rumbling and roaring of mankind, can be said in three words.” - F.Kürnberger [used as introductory premise of [*Tractatus Logico Philosophicus*](https://writing.upenn.edu/library/Wittgenstein-Tractatus.pdf) by [*Ludwig Wittgenstein*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein).

- [**Chatalet**](https://github.com/prikarsartam/Chatalet) concerns abstractive text summarisation with multilabel classification with further plan to create a *allure-filter* to integrate with it for enticing headline generation.

- [**Jokerman**](https://github.com/prikarsartam/Jokerman) is a text classification system to determine the level semantic integrety in a syntagma.

- [Ising_Monte-Carlo](https://github.com/prikarsartam/Statistical-Spin-System-Simulation-using-MonteCarlo-Algorithm) uses random number generation method to determine the ground point configuration of a 2D classical 2-level interactive spin system with distinguishing the phase-transition structure underneath and numerically extrapolating the critical exponents for the system at the criticality. 

- [**Drone-Control**](https://github.com/prikarsartam/Drone-Control) is a software backup for very simple hardware setup for BLDC drones with NODEMCU/ESP32 integrated single *flight controller + receiver* module including 4-channel [*WebSocket*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) included JavaScript remote controller for universal and reliable communication.
